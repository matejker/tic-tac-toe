# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe or in british english noughts and crosses is an ancient game which every seven years old children learns 
how to play and not to lose in exactly nine plays or so. Why would you spend your time with playing and studying such 
a triviality? Well, I got interested in Reinforcement learning recently. So I can use it for 
[some more nasty stuff](https://github.com/matejker/controllability-of-complex-networks) 
and tic-tac-toe is a classic example such that even Sutton & Barto [3] don't hesitate to put it into the book's 
introduction.
